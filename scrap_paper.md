Is it possible to have a standalone production-ready app with comprehensive lifecycle and string-based processing to connect to the raw-trades kafka topic, preform stream processing, then have a user interface (it doesn't have to be spring boot) to view the end result and see if it produces the desired results? I intend to generate different stream processing topologies, so id like the UI to be flexible and be able to display results without much hassel.
